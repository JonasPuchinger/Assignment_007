a) "Critical path" is a term associated with a variant of the original GOMS-model, CPM-GOMS. 
CPM does not only stand for "Critical-Path-Method", a project development method, but also "Cognitive Perceptual Motor", referring to the different types of operators used in this GOMS-model.
Contrary to the original GOMS-model, CPM-GOMS can model multitasking, making it more precise, but also more costly in regards to the work one has to put in.
The critical path is the sequence of activities in a GOMS-process which takes the most time to complete. 
Therefore the critical path describes the total time needed to complete a given task.
